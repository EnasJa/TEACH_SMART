            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>In many schools, teachers face significant gaps in the learning levels of students within a single classroom. Managing a wide range of learning levels and personal progress creates substantial challenges in classroom management and curriculum adaptation.</p>
            <p>The problem consists of several main components:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Early identification of learning difficulties:</strong> Teachers struggle to identify students with learning difficulties in real-time. These students do not receive the necessary support at the appropriate time.</li>
                <li><strong>Continuous monitoring of student progress:</strong> It is difficult for teachers to continuously track each student's progress. Furthermore, the feedback provided to students is not always accurate and effective.</li>
            </ul>
